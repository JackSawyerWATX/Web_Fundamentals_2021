    <p>These are the lyrics to a song I have really liked for a long time. For a while after I first heard it, I considered it to be my favorite song. The name of it is Burden In My Hand written by Chris Cornell and preformed by Soundgarden originally for the album, Down On The Upside, released in 1996 by A&M Records.</p>

        Follow me into the desert
        As thirsty as you are
        Crack a smile and cut your mouth
        And drown in alcohol
        'Cause down below the truth is lying
        Beneath the river bed
        Quench yourself and drink the water
        That flows below her head
        Oh no there she goes
    </p>
    <p>
        Out in the sunshine
        The sun is mine, sun is mine
        I shot my love today
        Would you cry for me
    </p>
    <p>
        I lost my head again
        Would you lie for me
        Close your eyes and bow your head
        I need a little sympathy
    </p>
    <p>
        'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
        Who isn't me
        Kill your health and kill yourself
        And kill everything you love
        And if you live you can fall to pieces
        And suffer with my ghost
        I shot my love today
        Would you cry for me
    </p>
    <p>
        I lost my head again
        Would you lie for me
        I left her in the sand
        Just a burden in my hand
        I lost my head again
        Would you cry for me
        Just a burden in my hand
    </p>
    <p>
        Just an anchor on my heart
        It's just a tumor in my head
        And I'm in the dark
        So follow me into the desert
    </p>
    <p>
        As desperate as you are
        Where the moon is glued
        To a picture of heaven
        And all the little pigs have God
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh no there she goes
        Out in the sunshine
        The sun is mine, the sun is mine
        I shot my love today
    </p>
    <p>
        Would you cry for me, yeah
        I lost my head again
        Would you lie for me
        I left her in the sand
        Just a burden in my hand
        I lost my head again
        Would you cry for me
        Would you cry for me
    </p>
